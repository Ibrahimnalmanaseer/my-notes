## Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset
<br>

The most important technique the developer must have is to keep the **software simple**, **more reliable**, and **easy to understand by other developers** :



- keeping away from complexity by understanding the main purpose of the software, designing the system in a way that can be easily maintained, and trying to reduce the complexity in each code section.

- define the priorities (focus on the most important features), understand the problem you are facing to be able to fix it, don't assume and predict future errors and needs, and stick with the current system requirements.

- always test your code, automate and avoid repeating your code, use "why" when commenting, and set good documentation to be easy to understand by the new developers.

- always picking the needed tools and packages, etc.
focusing on self-development and trying to learn new skills and technologies.
